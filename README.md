# LatinTranslate
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/tada66/latintranslate/badge/master)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/tada66/latintranslate/overview/master)

LatinTranslate is a simple console program to help anyone when translating latin. 
For now only nouns are supported and I plan to have the entire noun translation complete by October.
Next up will be support for verbs and after those are added, the app will get a simple gui.
